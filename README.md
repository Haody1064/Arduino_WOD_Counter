# Arduino_Prototyping_WOD_Counter
## 0. INSPIRATION:
* CrossFit is military-style workouts. Often, the goal is to do as many sets and reps possible in a given time.
> For example: 
>> Complete as many rounds as possible in 6 minutes of: 
>>> 12 power cleans
>>> 21 squats 
>> Say finishing 12 power cleans and 21 squats is one set, then the remainder goes to reps when time is up.
*  To better focus on the workout and avoid cracking my cellphone, so I came up with this device.

## 1.PRODUCT DESIGN:

## 2.PLANING AND EXECUTION:
* Used a Arduino simulatior and implemented code test product functionality.

  > Holding two buttons resets the score counter
* PCB design (status pending) <br>
* 3D print housing and physical buttons (status pending)
