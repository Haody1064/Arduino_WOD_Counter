# Arduino_Prototyping_WOD_Counter
## INSPIRATION:
  * <p> CrossFit is military-style workouts. Often, the goal is to do as many sets and reps possible in a given time.<br>
   &ensp;&ensp; For example: <br> 
     &ensp;&ensp;&ensp; Complete as many rounds as possible in 6 minutes of: <br>
      &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; 12 power cleans <br>
      &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; 21 squats <br>
     &ensp;&ensp;&ensp; Say finishing 12 power cleans and 21 squats is one set, then the remainder goes to reps when time is up. <br>
  
  * To better focus on the workout and to avoid cracking my cellphone, so I came up with this device.<br> </P>

## PLANING AND EXECUTION:
* Used a Arduino simulatior and implemented code test product functionality.
* <img src="https://github.com/Haody1064/Arduino_WOD_Counter/blob/main/gif_and_images/CircuitSimulation.png" />
  
* Assembly (see DEMO below).
* <img src="https://github.com/Haody1064/Arduino_WOD_Counter/blob/main/gif_and_images/ezgif.com-gif-maker.gif" />
* PCB design (status pending indefinitely) 
* 3D print housing and physical buttons (status pending indefinitely)
