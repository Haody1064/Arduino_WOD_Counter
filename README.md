# Arduino_Prototyping_WOD_Counter
## Inspiration:
  * CrossFit is military-style workouts. Often, the goal is to do as many sets and reps possible in a given time.
  * To better focus on the workout, I came up with this device.

##PLANING AND EXECUTION:
* Used a simulation to build circuits and implement codes.

* Assembly (see DEMO)
* PCB design (status pending indefinitely) 
* 3D print housing and physical buttons (status pending indefinitely)
