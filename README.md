# Arduino_Prototyping_WOD_Counter
## INSPIRATION:
  > * CrossFit is military-style workouts. Often, the goal is to do as many sets and reps possible in a given time.
  >> For example: 
  >>> Complete as many rounds as possible in 6 minutes of: 
  >>>>> 12 power cleans
  >>>>> 21 squats 
  >>>>> Say finishing 12 power cleans and 21 squats is one set, then the remainder goes to reps when time is up.
  
  > *  To better focus on the workout and avoid cracking my cellphone, so I came up with this device.
