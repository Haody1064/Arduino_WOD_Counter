# Arduino_Prototyping_WOD_Counter
## INSPIRATION:
  * <p> CrossFit is military-style workouts. Often, the goal is to do as many sets and reps possible in a given time.<br>
  <p> For example: <br> 
    <p> Complete as many rounds as possible in 6 minutes of: <br>
     <p> 12 power cleans <br>
     <p> 21 squats <br>
  
  * <p> To better focus on the workout, I came up with this device.<br>
